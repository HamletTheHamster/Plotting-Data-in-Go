24-11-23,chip with UHNA1 sample stage,1,16:30:45,16:58:56,1,1,1,1/frequency.csv,1/signal.csv,0.8,1,100,1.842000e+09,8,1.060000e+10,1.110000e+10,2.004567e+06,5,1549,1549.046,1549.087,1549.149,with chip but poor alignment of chip and right PBS
24-11-23,no chip just UHNA1 sample stage,2,17:13:09,17:41:20,1,1,1,2/frequency.csv,2/signal.csv,0.8,1,100,1.842000e+09,8,1.060000e+10,1.110000e+10,2.004567e+06,5,1549,1549.046,1549.087,1549.149,welp UHNA1 resonance is same as SMF28. cool.
