22-8-16,3 GHz CS2,1,98.7,38.51,36.00,1/frequency.csv,1/signal.csv,probe 1549.024 filter 1549.05 - success: ~1.5x larger than yesterday (and cleaner)
,4 GHz CS2,2,100.5,38.04,35.56,2/frequency.csv,2/signal.csv,DITHER probe 1549.032 filter 1549.06 - success: ~10x smaller than 3 GHz - flatter on either side of peak
,4 GHz CS2,3,101.7,36.48,37.15,3/frequency.csv,3/signal.csv,probe 1549.032 filter 1549.06 - success: 5x smaller than previous run with dither (!)
,4 GHz CS2,4,99.5,38.57,35.71,4/frequency.csv,4/signal.csv,probe 1549.032 filter 1549.06 - cool sig gen .5 hr - success: same height as dither run 2 maybe cleaner
,5 GHz CS2,5,101.4,37.96,36.67,5/frequency.csv,5/signal.csv,probe 1549.04 filter 1549.065 - cool sig gen .5 hr - success: just shy of 4GHz height (.00005)
,6 GHz CS2,6,99.6,38.67,36.14,6/frequency.csv,6/signal.csv,*Range 200 mV* probe 1549.048 filter 1549.072 - cool sig gen w air gun - success: .000004 but major instrument noise defect
