First Try even. powers are hard to say because reflections. Gathered @tap by turning each up individually with other two turned down, units in uW. Don't think any of them are accurate, and yes I got negative reading on stokes, but all of these seemed to be different before the measurement started. The signal generator overheated and might not be working properly now. Idk.
